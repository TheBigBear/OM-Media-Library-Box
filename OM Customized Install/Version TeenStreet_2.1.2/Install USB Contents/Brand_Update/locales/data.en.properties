aboutFilesTopHeader = About TeenStreet
aboutFilesTopText = TeenStreet is an international Christian congress for teenagers. We work with the Church to motivate, equip and walk alongside (Christian) teens from all across Europe to have a real friendship with Jesus and reflect Him daily in their world.  TeenStreet started in 1993 with a total of 53 teenagers and has grown rapidly. Today, about 4,500 participants and volunteers from over 20 nations attend the conference.  We are committed to working with churches and youth groups, supporting them in their ministry to teenagers. At the same time, we emphasise cooperation with churches, because it’s so important that teenagers have a Christian community to be part of after TeenStreet.  At TeenStreet we want to encourage teenagers in their walk with Jesus and help them make wise decisions. That is why every participant is part of a small group. Members of a small group share the same language and are the same age. Their adult leader supports them and shares his or her personal relationship with Jesus with them. During the main meetings the teenagers also learn about living in relationship with God. They take what they hear in the main meetings to their small groups to reflect on it and apply it to their lives at home. In addition, TeenStreet offers many exciting things for the teenagers to take part in, including sports, creative arts, seminars and workshops. They also have free time to get to know people from other countries, with different cultural and church backgrounds.
aboutFilesMiddleHeader = Core Values
aboutFilesMiddleText = IMPACT: We want to make a lasting impact in the lives of teenagers. This means helping teens to understand and come to their own decisions rather than telling them what they must do. Small groups and personal study are a vital part of helping teens to apply the teaching to their own lives.  --  RELATIONSHIPS: We want teens to have a real relationship with God and healthy relationships with other people. We aim to love God and love each other at TeenStreet. We will provide opportunities for teens to develop their friendship with Jesus, their relationship with other teens and their relationships with trusted adults. -- EMPOWERMENT: We want to raise up a generation of people who trust God to use them now, not only in some remote future. We want teenagers to be able to serve God in many different ways, using their own gifting and passions. This is about doing things together for God and a hurting world!
