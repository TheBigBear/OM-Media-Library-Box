					<p data-l10n-id="aboutFilesTopText">Transforming Lives and Communities <br><br> For over 50 years, Operation Mobilization (OM) has been bringing the message of hope through Jesus Christ to men, women, and children around the world. Though we have over 3,400 volunteers and staff serving with OM in 118 nations, we have one thing in common — we love Jesus and we want others to have the opportunity to hear about Him.<br> <br> Through Bible studies, teaching students, building businesses, relief and development work, the creative arts and much, much more — by all means possible, we partner with the local church to tell people how our lives have been changed and how they too can meet Jesus!<br> <br>We are a collective of 3,400 people who don’t fit a mold, who don’t sit still, and who love the adventure of serving Jesus. We live in the remote corners of the world and the city-centers. We feed the hungry and heal the sick.

				<div class="small">
                   <p data-l10n-id="aboutFilesBottomText">We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.<br><br>We believe in the absolute deity and full humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ. We believe in His virgin birth, His sinless life, the authenticity of His miracles, His vicarious and atoning death, His bodily resurrection and His present mediatorial work in heaven.<br><br>We believe in the personality and deity of the Holy Spirit. We believe He gives life, He sanctifies, He empowers and comforts all believers.<br><br>We believe that the Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments in their original texts, are fully inspired by the Holy Spirit, without error, and are the final authority for the Church.<br><br>We believe that man was originally created sinless. Tempted by Satan, man fell and thereby brought the whole race under the condemnation of eternal separation from God.<br><br>We believe that man is saved through repentance and faith in the finished work of Christ. Justification is through grace alone.<br><br>We believe that the Church is the body of Jesus Christ composed of all true believers. The present work of the Church is the worship of God, the perfecting of the saints and the evangelization of the world.<br><br>We believe in the personal and bodily return of the Lord Jesus Christ to consummate our salvation and establish His glorious Kingdom.<br>
